# multicloud-deploy

Ansible project to create and maintain a [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/)
service that will be used to continuous deploy our [Tsuru](https://tsuru.io/) [environment](https://github.com/alphagov/tsuru-terraform).

This project uses the [Jenkins Job DSL](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin) to define a job
as code and store that job using a version management system. 

This project implements the use of an [ansible dynamic inventory](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/getting-started-with-ansible-and-dynamic-amazon-ec2-inventory-management/)
Script and configuration file used for dynamic inventory on aws (ec2.py and ec2.ini) are part of [ansible plugins](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/plugins/inventory)

No changes should be made to the jenkins server manually as they will not
persist if the virtual instance is ever destroyed and re-created.

The Jenkins server is configured to use [GitHub authorization](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+OAuth+Plugin) [strategy](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Role+Strategy+Plugin), where you can define user access levels based on which GitHub organizations they are members of.

[Openconnect VPN client](http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/) is installed to allow Jenkins access our internal GitHub.

## Requirements
 
* `ansible`

* Python things (you may wish to use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)):
```
pip install -Ur requirements.txt
```

## Fetching Ansible Galaxy playbook dependencies

Use the [ansible-galaxy](http://docs.ansible.com/galaxy.html#advanced-control-over-role-requirements-files) command to install third-party playbooks:

`ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`

## Testing

A [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) file has been provided for local testing it can be brought up by running:

`vagrant up --provision`

There is also a helper [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction) in the base directory of this project 
that will automatically bring up the environment by running:

`make vagrant` and browsing to `https://127.0.0.1:8443`

The `vagrant` provisioning run does not configure the following items:

* `Openconnect VPN client` - since this would make the vagrant instance unreachable,
* [GitHub authentication strategy](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+OAuth+Plugin) - since this would make the jenkins site unconfigurable.

## Preparation

For deployment on aws, you must have the following environment variables set:

* [AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-environment)
* [AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-environment)

For GitHub integration you will also need to:
* [register](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) a new developer application in your GitHub account
* set GitHub application [callback URL](https://developer.github.com/guides/basics-of-authentication/#registering-your-app) to `https://<my.jenkins.server>/securityRealm/finishLogin`
* configure `client_id` and `client_secret` with the tokens you get after registering the GitHub application
* in case you are not using `GitHub.com`, also configure `github_hostname`, `github_web_uri` and `github_api_uri`
* if your custom server is using self signed certificate, you can define `github_cert` variable to specify your certificate, e.g.:

```yaml
---
github_cert: |
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  < ssl certificate content >
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

You can add your own groups, as well as override default ones by adjusting the `permissions` variable. You can define user to role mapping in `roles`, e.g.:

```yaml
---
permissions:
  admins:
    - hudson.scm.SCM.Tag
    - hudson.model.Run.Delete
    - hudson.model.View.Read
    - ...
  mygroup:
    - hudson.model.View.Create
    - hudson.model.View.Read
    - hudson.model.View.Delete

roles:
  admins:
    - janedoe
  mygroup:
    - johndoe
```

After GitHub authentication strategy is enabled, you will also need to define `jenkins_admin_user` and `jenkins_api_token`. This will enable further updates of Jenkins and job configuration via ansible. User's [api_token](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Authenticating+scripted+clients) is available in user configuration.

This repository is using `ansible-vault` to secure sensitive information - If you already know the password you do not need to recreate the 'vault' file.

Encrypt your vault file using `ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/all/vault`

As an example your `vault` could contain the following variables that you may wish to keep secret:

```
vpn_url: "https://my.ssl.vpn.uri"
vpn_user: "my.vpn.user"
vpn_password: "my.vpn.password"

github_web_uri: "https://github.com"
github_api_uri: "https://github.com/api/v3"
client_id: "my.github.client.id"
client_secret: "my.github.client.secret"
github_hostname: "github.com"

jenkins_admin_user: "janedoe"
jenkins_api_token: "my.jenkins.api.token"

roles:
  admins:
    - janedoe
  github_orgs:
    - my-github-org

keystore_password: "my.java.keystore.password"
github_cert: |
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```
=======
## DNS

### AWS

If you use AWS [Route53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/) as a DNS provider you can define `r53_zone` and `dns_name` variables. A `{{dns_name}}.{{r53_zone}}` DNS record will be created/updated for the Jenkins server and set to it's external IP.

##Â Deployment

`ansible-playbook -i localhost, <PROVIDER_NAME>-provision.yml -v --vault-password-file vault_password.sh`

`ansible-playbook -i ec2.py site.yml -v --vault-password-file vault_password.sh`

Or:

`make <PROVIDER_NAME>`

Where:

- `<PROVIDER_NAME>` is: aws or gce

## Known bugs/issues

* At this moment, only the 'aws' platform is supported
* You will need to log in to jenkins to obtain the `jenkins_api_token` and add it to your ansible `globals.yml` or `vault` file to enable subsequent jenkins and job configuration
